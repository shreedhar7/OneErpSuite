OneErpSuite: The Complete Quarry and Crusher Management Solution
Overview I developed OneErpSuite, a powerful management app for quarry and crusher business owners, entirely from scratch using React Native and Expo. From designing the interface on Figma to deploying on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, I took this project from concept to launch. Along the way, I learned, built, and optimized every part of the app to make it a comprehensive tool for business owners.

Learning and Building: My Developer Journey
To prepare for building OneErpSuite, I immersed myself in a 3-month training program on React Native. This included online courses, tutorials, and hands-on projects. After building a foundation, I tackled this ambitious project, leveraging various libraries and packages to enhance functionality and streamline development. Some of the essential libraries I used include:

React Navigation for seamless navigation across the app

Async Storage for state management, ensuring data consistency

Axios for handling API requests efficiently

React Native Paper for clean and responsive UI components

Lottie for animations to enhance user experience

AsyncStorage for persistent storage of user data

These libraries, along with others, allowed me to build an app that feels native, intuitive, and responsive.

API and Authentication: Secure and User-Friendly Access
The login interface was a key part of the user experience. I created a secure and simple login screen, enabling users to log in and access data quickly. Working with APIs to fetch and display data was crucial. The app securely communicates with backend servers to pull real-time data, enabling quarry and crusher owners to view reports, monitor sales, and manage inventory with ease.

Figma-Driven Design: Crafting an Intuitive User Experience
Before jumping into development, I designed every screen in Figma to ensure a cohesive, visually appealing interface. By planning out each element, I was able to create a polished UI that’s easy to navigate and effective for busy business owners. The Figma designs served as my roadmap and allowed for a smooth development process, ensuring the final product was both functional and attractive.
